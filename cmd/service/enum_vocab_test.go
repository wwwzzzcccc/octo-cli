// This PR promotes spec `enum` from help text into a pre-flight gate: an
// out-of-vocabulary value exits 2 with ENUM_NOT_ALLOWED and sends no HTTP. That
// gate is global — it applies to every enabled spec, not just the domain this PR
// adds — so every request-side vocabulary in the registry became load-bearing at
// once. A vocabulary *narrower* than its backend now turns a working call into a
// hard local failure, and no response can teach the CLI otherwise.
//
// Round 8 found four such vocabularies in three domains that no earlier round had
// looked at, because they live in specs a PR titled feat(drive) does not touch.
// This table is the fix for the class rather than the four instances: it pins
// every request-side enum in every enabled spec, in both directions.
//
//   - a vocabulary whose values drift from this table fails
//   - a vocabulary that is not in this table at all fails
//   - a table entry whose vocabulary has disappeared fails
//
// The middle rule is the one that matters: it means a spec author cannot add an
// enum — and with it a new hard gate — without transcribing the backend's set and
// recording where it came from.
//
// Provenance is required, not decorative. Each entry names the backend definition
// it was transcribed from, at a *remote* ref: a local checkout that is behind
// origin will happily confirm a stale vocabulary. Three of the four round-8
// findings were invisible in a checkout 40 commits behind main.

// vocabulary is one request-side enum and the backend authority for its values.
