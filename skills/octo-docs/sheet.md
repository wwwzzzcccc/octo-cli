# octo-docs — Spreadsheet cells, layout & rules (`doc_type: sheet`)

Read this when the target is a **spreadsheet** (`doc_type: sheet`) and you need to
read or edit its cells, column widths / row heights, floating images, hyperlinks,
merged ranges, sheet tabs, freeze panes, shared filters, sorting, checkbox and
dropdown validation rules, run find & replace, or export it.
All commands call `$OCTO_API_BASE_URL/v1/bot/docs/*`. Auth & space rules are in
`SKILL.md`.

Export a sheet to XLSX with a required, matching destination extension:

```bash
octo-cli docs export <docId> --export-format xlsx -o spreadsheet.xlsx
```

A spreadsheet stores a flat cell map on the Y.Doc, keyed `sheetId!row:col` (e.g.
`default!0:0`), with values `{v,f,s,p,t}` — `v` a string/number/boolean/null,
`f` an optional formula, `s` an opaque resolved style object, `p` Univer's
rich-text snapshot, and `t` the cell type. Rows are 0-based and may be 0..9999;
columns are 0-based and may be 0..99. All five fields round-trip untouched.
Same read-token-then-guarded-write discipline as the body surface.

```bash
# Read the LIVE cells + dims + hyperlinks + merges + sheet tabs + freeze +
# filters + validation/dropdown rules + baseVersion
# (reader). Response:
#   { docId, sheetCells: { "sheetId!row:col": {v,f,s,p,t} },
#     sheetDims: { "${logicalId}:c<idx>|${logicalId}:r<idx>|c<idx>|r<idx>": px },
#     sheetHyperLinks: { "sheetId!linkId": {id,row,column,payload,display?} },
#     sheetMerges: { "logicalId:sr:sc:er:ec": true },
#     sheetList: { "logicalId": {name,order,rowCount?,columnCount?} },
#     sheetFreeze: { "logicalId": {startRow,startColumn,xSplit,ySplit} },
#     sheetFilters: { "logicalId": {ref,filterColumns?:[{colId,filters}],enabledColumns?:[<absolute 0-based column>]} },
#     sheetDataValidations: { "logicalId": [checkbox/dropdown/other rules] },
#     baseVersion }
octo-cli docs sheet get <docId>

# Batch-edit cells (writer). --base-version is REQUIRED and is sent as the
# If-Match header; the cells batch goes through --data as a JSON object.
# A cell value of null DELETES that cell.
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" \
  --data '{"cells":{"default!0:0":{"v":"hi"},"default!1:0":null}}'
```

### Find and replace

Prefer the server-side replace command when the endpoint is available. It
computes one complete replacement batch against the `baseVersion` you read and
commits it atomically; a concurrent edit returns `412 base_version_stale`. If
this command returns 404 in a mixed-version environment, fall back to `docs
sheet get` plus an explicit `docs sheet edit` batch.

```bash
# Whole workbook, values, case-insensitive substring match (the defaults).
octo-cli docs sheet replace <docId> --base-version "<token>" \
  --data '{"findString":"old","replaceString":"new"}'

# One worksheet and one inclusive, 0-based selection (C2:E10).
octo-cli docs sheet replace <docId> --base-version "<token>" --data '{
  "findString":"=SUM(","replaceString":"=AVERAGE(","findBy":"formula",
  "caseSensitive":true,"matchesTheWholeCell":false,
  "logicalId":"default",
  "range":{"startRow":1,"startColumn":2,"endRow":9,"endColumn":4}
}'

# Delete matching text by using an empty replacement string.
octo-cli docs sheet replace <docId> --base-version "<token>" \
  --data '{"findString":"obsolete","replaceString":""}'
```

Scope rules: omit both `logicalId` and `range` for the whole workbook; send only
`logicalId` for one worksheet; send both for a rectangular selection. A `range`
without `logicalId` is invalid. `findBy` is `value` or `formula`. In value mode a
formula cell may count in `matchedCells` through its cached display value, but it
is only writable in formula mode, so `replacedCells` can be smaller. The server
trims `findString`, which must remain non-empty. Formula mode uses substring matching over formula source text.
A short string such as `SUM` also matches
`SUMIF` and `SUMPRODUCT`, so use an unambiguous string or a narrow selection and
read the formulas back afterwards. Value mode searches stored raw values, not
formatted display text; booleans are `1` and `0`. Whole-cell matching does not
match rich-text cells because their stored streams include paragraph terminators.
Replacement text is literal, including `$` sequences. The response also includes
the total occurrence count in `replacements` and a fresh `baseVersion`; when
nothing is replaceable, no version or Yjs update is created and the original base
version is returned.

### Freeze panes

Freeze rows and columns with one compact record per worksheet. Coordinates are
0-based. `xSplit` is the number of frozen columns and `ySplit` the number of
frozen rows. `startColumn` / `startRow` are the first scrollable column / row, so
freezing the first N columns / rows normally uses N for both the start and split
on that axis. Use `-1` as the `start*` value for an unfrozen axis. The server
also accepts `0` on an unfrozen axis but normalizes it to `-1` on readback.

```bash
# Freeze the header row and first column. Read a fresh baseVersion first.
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" --data '{
  "freeze":{"default":{"startRow":1,"startColumn":1,"xSplit":1,"ySplit":1}}
}'

# Freeze only the header row (column axis remains unfrozen).
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" \
  --data '{"freeze":{"default":{"startRow":1,"startColumn":-1,"xSplit":0,"ySplit":1}}}'

# Freeze only the first column (row axis remains unfrozen).
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" \
  --data '{"freeze":{"default":{"startRow":-1,"startColumn":1,"xSplit":1,"ySplit":0}}}'

# Remove all frozen panes from the default sheet.
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" \
  --data '{"freeze":{"default":null}}'
```

### Shared filter and sorting

A filter has a 0-based rectangular `ref`. Its first row is the header row and
is intentionally kept visible; criteria apply to the data rows below it. The
example below keeps rows whose column G raw value is `待处理` within G:M. This
is a value filter, not a font-color filter—cell font color does not decide whether a row
matches. `colId` is the absolute 0-based worksheet column, not an offset from
`ref.startColumn`. Filter state is shared, so collaborators see the same hidden
rows. If you send `filterColumns:[]`, the server keeps the filter range but omits
`filterColumns` from readback. `enabledColumns` is the non-empty set of absolute
0-based worksheet columns that visibly own filter buttons. Every entry must be
inside `ref`, and every `filterColumns.colId` must also appear in it; otherwise
the server rejects the edit with `422 sheet_cell_invalid`. The server removes
duplicates and sorts the list on readback. For example, a G:M backing range with
`enabledColumns:[6,12]` enables only G and M, not H–L. This controls filter-button
visibility only; it does not restrict reads or writes. Use protected ranges for
that. Filters are replace-style per logical sheet: read `sheetFilters` first and
resend the complete filter object, including `enabledColumns`, when changing
criteria. Omitting `enabledColumns` invokes legacy behavior and makes every
column in `ref` visible as a filter control. `enabledColumns:[]` is rejected; use
`{"filters":{"<logicalId>":null}}` to remove the filter and all controls.

```bash
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" --data '{
  "filters":{"default":{
    "ref":{"startRow":0,"startColumn":6,"endRow":100,"endColumn":12},
    "filterColumns":[{"colId":6,"filters":{"filters":["待处理"]}}],
    "enabledColumns":[6,12]
  }}
}'

# Remove the filter range and its criteria.
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" \
  --data '{"filters":{"default":null}}'
```

Sorting is different: there is no durable `sort` rule. It is a raw coordinate
rewrite, not a spreadsheet-native sort. Read the current cells, move the complete
selected row block, and carry every cell's complete `{v,f,s,p,t}` shape to its
destination in one guarded edit. Use `null` for destinations that become empty;
omitting them leaves old cells in place. The server stores `f` verbatim and does
not re-anchor relative formula references. Rewrite relative references for each
destination, or do not sort that range through this API. Never sort only the key
column; move every cell in each selected row so values, styles, rich text, and
cell types stay together.

The same raw-coordinate rule applies to any state keyed by or containing a
coordinate: row `dims`, `sheetDataValidations` ranges, `sheetHyperLinks`,
`sheetMerges`, drawings, and cell comments all stay at their old coordinates.
Freeze panes and filter ranges/columns also remain fixed, which is normally the
intended behavior. Remap affected row dims, validation ranges, hyperlink anchors,
and merge keys in the same atomic edit; because `dataValidations` is replace-
style, resend every rule you need to keep. `sheetDims` is one workbook-level map
whose keys may be sheet-qualified. When sorting a non-default tab, remap that
tab's `${logicalId}:r<idx>` keys; bare `r<idx>` keys address the legacy default
sheet. Reads return dimension keys exactly as stored.
Bare and prefixed keys for the default sheet are distinct stored entries. When
migrating a legacy bare key, read `sheetDims` first and clear the bare twin in
the same batch, for example `{"c0":null,"default:c0":200}`; otherwise both
entries remain and downstream precedence is undefined.
Drawings are not returned by `docs sheet get`, and cell comments are managed
outside the sheet-edit surface, so do not sort an affected range unless you
already have authoritative metadata and a safe way to preserve those anchors.

Rows hidden by an active shared filter still appear in `docs sheet get`. A full
rectangle rewrite therefore includes them. To sort only visible rows, evaluate
the current `sheetFilters` criteria before editing and build a sparse permutation
that leaves hidden row coordinates unchanged; clearing the filter does not
preserve the visible subset.

```bash
# Example result of sorting two A:D data rows by column A ascending. The old
# second row had an empty C cell, so its new destination is explicitly deleted.
# Column D held row-relative formulas; each f is rewritten for its destination.
# Every non-null value shown must come from the immediately preceding sheet get.
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" --data '{
  "cells":{
    "default!1:0":{"v":"a"},"default!1:1":{"v":"row-a"},"default!1:2":null,"default!1:3":{"f":"=LEN(B2)"},
    "default!2:0":{"v":"b"},"default!2:1":{"v":"row-b"},"default!2:2":{"v":"kept-with-row-b"},"default!2:3":{"f":"=LEN(B3)"}
  }
}'
```

### Single-select and multi-select dropdown lists

Dropdown lists are stored as data-validation rules. The public REST contract is
one array per logical sheet for every validation family; an array may mix
`list`, `listMultiple`, `checkbox`, and any other rules returned by the server.
Do not send the internal Y.Map's flat `${logicalId}!${uid}` key shape through
`dataValidations`; checkbox is not the sole supported rule family.

The server requires every rule to have a unique `uid` within the sheet and at
least one non-empty `ranges:[{startRow,startColumn,endRow,endColumn}]` entry. A
`uid` is 1–128 characters and must contain neither `!` nor control characters.
For a working colored dropdown, use `type:"list"` for a single selection or
`type:"listMultiple"` for multiple selections; set `formula1` to a
JSON-serialized string array, `formula2` to the same-length comma-separated
color list, `showDropDown:true`, and `renderMode:2`. Those dropdown fields are
recommended client-rendering inputs, not additional server-required fields.
Do not add an `operator` to either list type. A multi-select cell value uses the
same serialized JSON-array form (for example `"[\"待处理\",\"已完成\"]"`),
while a single-select cell stores the selected label directly.

`dataValidations` is replace-style per logical sheet: the array you send
replaces that sheet's entire rule set. Before adding or changing a dropdown,
read `sheetDataValidations` with `docs sheet get`, merge the intended change,
and resend every existing rule you need to keep. Do not make a replace-style
write if the deployed read surface cannot enumerate every validation family on
that sheet: a filtered read cannot preserve omitted rules.

The backend rejects overlap between checkbox rules after the complete edit, but
does not reject a `list` / `listMultiple` range that overlaps another validation
family. Treat those mixed-family overlaps as intentional client behavior rather
than assuming the REST API will reject them.

```bash
# One atomic edit creates both dropdown types and sets initial values. This
# array is complete only when the sheet has no other rules; otherwise start
# from sheetDataValidations and include every existing rule you need to keep.
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" --data '{
  "cells":{
    "default!1:0":{"v":"待处理"},
    "default!1:1":{"v":"[\"待处理\",\"已完成\"]"}
  },
  "dataValidations":{"default":[
    {
      "uid":"bot-status-single","type":"list",
      "formula1":"[\"待处理\",\"处理中\",\"已完成\"]",
      "formula2":"#E4F4FE,#FEF0E6,#EFFBD0",
      "showDropDown":true,"renderMode":2,
      "ranges":[{"startRow":1,"startColumn":0,"endRow":100,"endColumn":0}]
    },
    {
      "uid":"bot-status-multiple","type":"listMultiple",
      "formula1":"[\"待处理\",\"处理中\",\"已完成\"]",
      "formula2":"#E4F4FE,#FEF0E6,#EFFBD0",
      "showDropDown":true,"renderMode":2,
      "ranges":[{"startRow":1,"startColumn":1,"endRow":100,"endColumn":1}]
    }
  ]}
}'

# Replace all rules on the sheet with an empty set (null works too).
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" \
  --data '{"dataValidations":{"default":[]}}'
```

Each successful edit returns a new `baseVersion`; use that new value for the
next edit. Reusing an older token correctly fails with `412 base_version_stale`.

### Column widths, row heights, and images

```bash
# Set column widths / row heights via the optional `dims` batch. Use
# `${logicalId}:c<idx>` / `${logicalId}:r<idx>` for a specific tab; bare
# `c<idx>` / `r<idx>` addresses the legacy default sheet. The two forms are
# separate stored keys, so clear a legacy bare twin while migrating. A null
# deletes a dim.
# `dims` may be the only non-empty surface in a guarded batch; across the whole
# request, at least one sheet edit surface must be non-empty.
# These are the same `sheetDims` values `docs sheet get` returns.
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" \
  --data '{"dims":{"c0":null,"default:c0":200,"default:r3":40,"default:c5":null}}'

# Insert / remove a FLOATING IMAGE via the optional `drawings` batch, keyed
# `${sheetId}!${drawingId}`. The value is a serialized Univer ISheetImage with
# the bytes inline as a base64 data URL in `source`; `drawingId` MUST equal the
# key's id. A null value deletes that image. `transform` is the pixel box;
# `sheetTransform` anchors it to a cell range (from/to). Drawings are the one
# worksheet resource not returned by `docs sheet get`.
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" --data '{
  "drawings": { "default!img1": {
    "drawingId": "img1", "drawingType": 0, "imageSourceType": "BASE64",
    "source": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo...",
    "transform": {"left":100,"top":100,"width":80,"height":80,"angle":0,"flipX":false,"flipY":false,"skewX":0,"skewY":0},
    "sheetTransform": {"from":{"column":1,"row":1,"columnOffset":0,"rowOffset":0},"to":{"column":2,"row":3,"columnOffset":0,"rowOffset":0}},
    "axisAlignSheetTransform": {"from":{"column":1,"row":1,"columnOffset":0,"rowOffset":0},"to":{"column":2,"row":3,"columnOffset":0,"rowOffset":0},"angle":0,"flipX":false,"flipY":false,"skewX":0,"skewY":0}
  } }
}'
```

### Checkboxes in the same `dataValidations` array

A checkbox is a cell value plus a `type:"checkbox"` validation rule inside the
same complete per-sheet array described above. Ranges use 0-based, inclusive
coordinates and must target an existing sheet. `formula1` / `formula2` are
optional, distinct strings. They default to `"1"` / `"0"`, whose cell values are
numeric `1` (checked) and `0` (unchecked). A custom pair such as `"YES"` / `"NO"`
instead uses those strings as the cell values. The server forces
`allowBlank:true`, so an empty checkbox cell stays valid.

The complete optional rule surface is `formula1`, `formula2`, `error`,
`errorTitle`, `prompt`, `promptTitle`, `showDropDown`, `showErrorMessage`,
`showInputMessage`, `operator`, `imeMode`, `errorStyle`, `renderMode`, and
`bizInfo:{showTime?}`. The text fields are bounded strings; formulas are literal
values and cannot start with `=`. Boolean fields must be booleans. `operator` is
one of `between`, `equal`, `greaterThan`, `greaterThanOrEqual`, `lessThan`,
`lessThanOrEqual`, `notBetween`, or `notEqual`; `imeMode` is 0..10 and
`errorStyle` / `renderMode` are 0..2.

Checkbox ranges must not overlap another checkbox rule after the complete edit.
To update or remove one checkbox, read `sheetDataValidations`, modify the matching
rule inside that sheet's array, and resend every checkbox, dropdown, and other
rule you intend to keep. Sending `[]` or `null` removes every validation rule for
that sheet. Deleting a sheet tab automatically deletes all validation rules owned
by that tab.

If a read or write returns `413 sheet_too_large` with `baseVersion` and
`repairDataValidationKey` under the CLI error `detail`, the server could not
finish its bounded checkbox-rule inspection. This is the one server-directed
exception to the grouped public shape: delete only that returned internal key
with the returned version, read again, and repeat if another repair key is
returned:

```bash
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<error.detail.baseVersion>" \
  --data '{"dataValidations":{"<error.detail.repairDataValidationKey>":null}}'
```

Do not mix cells or other changes into this repair PATCH or invent a flat key.
The backend only returns this repair key for checkbox-shaped stored metadata and
only permits the PATCH when deleting that exact key strictly shrinks the raw
checkbox metadata. After a successful PATCH, read again; completion means the
read succeeds without another repair key.

```bash
# Create an unchecked checkbox in A2 atomically with its initial value.
# The array below is complete only when the sheet has no other validation rules.
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" --data '{
  "cells": { "default!1:0": { "v": 0 } },
  "dataValidations": { "default": [{
    "uid": "checkbox-a2", "type": "checkbox",
    "formula1": "1", "formula2": "0",
    "ranges": [{"startRow":1,"startColumn":0,"endRow":1,"endColumn":0}]
  }] }
}'

# Remove all validation rules from this sheet. To remove only this checkbox,
# resend the complete array without checkbox-a2. Delete its cell value separately.
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" --data '{
  "cells": { "default!1:0": null },
  "dataValidations": { "default": [] }
}'
```

### Math formulas — a float-DOM drawing in the same `drawings` batch

A math formula is stored as a drawing too (same `sheetDrawings` map), but as a
**float-DOM** drawing (`drawingType: 8`), NOT an image: it has no `source` —
instead `componentKey: "octo-math-formula"` and the LaTeX in `data.latex`.
`sheetTransform.from` anchors it to a cell (`row`/`column`, 0-based). Backslashes
in LaTeX must be JSON-escaped (`\\frac`, `\\sqrt`). `data.id` must equal the
`drawingId`. Like all drawings it is **write-only** — `docs sheet get` does NOT
return it, so you can't read a formula back to verify.

```bash
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" --data '{
  "drawings": { "default!formula-1": {
    "drawingId": "formula-1", "drawingType": 8, "componentKey": "octo-math-formula",
    "data": { "latex": "\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}", "id": "formula-1", "fontSize": 20 },
    "transform": {"left":100,"top":80,"width":120,"height":40},
    "sheetTransform": {"from":{"column":1,"row":1,"columnOffset":0,"rowOffset":0},"to":{"column":2,"row":2,"columnOffset":0,"rowOffset":0}}
  } }
}'
```

### Cell hyperlinks — the `hyperlinks` batch

A cell hyperlink is its OWN edit surface, not a cell field: a link lives in the
`sheetHyperLinks` map and points back at a cell by `row`/`column`. Put the
visible text in the cell's `v` separately. Each entry is keyed
`${sheetId}!${linkId}` (linkId alnum/`-`/`_`) and
is `{ id, row, column, payload, display? }` where `id` MUST equal the key's linkId,
`payload` is the URL (only `http`/`https`/`mailto`, or an internal `#…` jump — other
schemes are rejected), and `display` is an optional label. A null value deletes a
link. Unlike drawings, hyperlinks ARE returned by `docs sheet get` (as
`sheetHyperLinks`), so you can read them back.

```bash
# Cell A1 shows the text "官网" and links to a URL (two surfaces in one edit).
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" --data '{
  "cells": { "default!0:0": { "v": "官网" } },
  "hyperlinks": { "default!lnk1": {
    "id": "lnk1", "row": 0, "column": 0,
    "payload": "https://example.com", "display": "官网"
  } }
}'
```

### Merged cells — the `merges` batch

A merged range is its own edit surface (the `sheetMerges` map), keyed
`${logicalId}:sr:sc:er:ec` — 0-based `startRow:startCol:endRow:endCol`. The value
is `true` to merge that block, or `null` to un-merge it. `logicalId` is the sheet's
id (`default` for the first tab). Merging keeps only the top-left cell's value; write
that cell's `v` in the same edit if you want text in the block. Merges ARE returned
by `docs sheet get` (as `sheetMerges`), so you can read them back and an xlsx export
can carry them.

```bash
# Merge A1:C2 (rows 0-1, cols 0-2) and put a title in the top-left cell.
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" --data '{
  "cells": { "default!0:0": { "v": "2025 年度报表" } },
  "merges": { "default:0:0:1:2": true }
}'

# Un-merge that block.
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" \
  --data '{"merges":{"default:0:0:1:2":null}}'
```

### Multiple sheet tabs — the `sheets` batch

A workbook's tabs live in the `sheetList` map, keyed by `logicalId` with value
`{name, order, rowCount?, columnCount?}` (order sorts the tabs left→right).
`rowCount` is the declared visible row count from 1 through 10000 and
`columnCount` is the declared visible column count from 1 through 100. The
backend stores explicit counts when it creates a new tab, defaulting to 200 rows
by 20 columns (A-T); missing stored counts therefore identify a pre-existing
legacy 1000-row by 100-column tab. The first/default tab has
logicalId `default`. This is its own edit surface (the `sheets` batch) and IS
returned by `docs sheet get` (as `sheetList`), so **read the current tabs first** to
learn their logicalIds before renaming, reordering, or adding one.

- **Rename / reorder** an existing tab: set its logicalId to new `{name, order}`;
  omitting either count preserves that dimension.
- **Resize** a tab explicitly: send `{name, order, rowCount, columnCount}`. The
  `name` and `order` fields remain required on every non-null entry. The
  usual growth path needs no separate resize call: writing a non-null cell at a
  row index `>= rowCount` or column index `>= columnCount` grows that dimension
  in the same atomic edit. For example, writing `default!299:20` grows a fresh
  200-by-20 tab to 300 rows by 21 columns (through column U). Automatic growth
  is capped at 10000 rows and 100 columns; writes past either cap fail with
  `422 sheet_cell_invalid`.
- **Read / export boundary**: shrinking changes only the declared boundary; it
  does not delete stored cells or coordinate-bearing worksheet resources below
  or to the right of it. Treat rows `>= rowCount` and columns `>= columnCount` as
  hidden/inactive and exclude them from local reconstruction exports; they can
  become active again after explicit regrowth. Only non-null cell writes trigger
  automatic growth, so explicitly resize before adding other resources beyond
  the current boundary. For a legacy entry without counts, use 1000 rows and
  100 columns as the effective boundary.
- **Add a NEW sheet**: pick a fresh logicalId, set it in `sheets` AND write that
  sheet's cells with keys `${logicalId}!row:col` in the SAME edit — a tab with no
  cells is an empty sheet, and cells whose logicalId has no tab are orphaned (the
  frontend won't render them). logicalId must not contain `:` or `!`.
- **Delete** a tab: set its logicalId to `null` (also delete its cells if you want
  them gone).

```bash
# 1) read the existing tabs
octo-cli docs sheet get <docId> --format json | jq '.data.sheetList'
#   e.g. { "default": { "name": "Sheet1", "order": 0, "rowCount": 200, "columnCount": 20 } }

# 2) rename the default tab AND add a second sheet "明细" with one cell in it
octo-cli docs sheet edit <docId> --base-version "<token>" --data '{
  "sheets": {
    "default": { "name": "汇总", "order": 0 },
    "detail-1": { "name": "明细", "order": 1 }
  },
  "cells": { "detail-1!0:0": { "v": "明细表" } }
}'
```

## Value types & number formats — use `sheet-cell`

Plain values are easy: a JSON number stays a number (`{"v":82}`, NOT the quoted
`{"v":"82"}` — a quoted numeric lands as text with the green "number stored as
text" warning); `true`/`false` a boolean; a string a string; a formula goes in
`f`, not `v`.

**Formatted values are the trap.** Dates, times, percentages, currency, thousands
separators are all stored the same non-obvious way: a plain **number** in `v`
plus a **number-format pattern** in `s.n.pattern`, with `t:2`. Two things bite
every time you hand-assemble this:

- a date is NOT the string `"2025-01-10"` — it's the serial **number** `45667`
  (days since 1899-12-30). Writing the ISO string stores TEXT, not a date.
- it's easy to set `v` right but forget `s.n.pattern`/`t`, so the value shows
  unformatted or as text.

So **do not hand-build the cell object — use the offline `octo-cli sheet-cell`
helper.** You give a natural value, it returns the exact `{v, s:{n:{pattern}}, t:2}`
object (serial computed, percentage converted, pattern attached). No token/network.

```bash
octo-cli sheet-cell --date 2025-01-10          # -> {"v":45667,"s":{"n":{"pattern":"yyyy-mm-dd"}},"t":2}
octo-cli sheet-cell --datetime "2025-01-10 12:00"   # -> v 45667.5, pattern yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm
octo-cli sheet-cell --percent 25               # -> v 0.25, pattern 0%   (stores the FRACTION)

# Take .data and drop it under a cell key in a sheet edit (bash embeds the output):
octo-cli docs sheet edit d_123 --base-version "$BV" \

```

Pass exactly one value source. `sheet-cell` emits the standard success envelope —
take `.data` for the raw cell object. Dates are exact for any date from 1900-03-01
on (every real-world date).

### What it produces (for reference / the long tail)

`pattern` is a standard **Excel number-format code** — the backend stores it
verbatim and Univer's numfmt engine renders it, so anything Excel supports works
via `--number ... --pattern ...`. Common cases (all round-trip verified):

| Kind | `sheet-cell` flag | `v` stores | `pattern` | Displays |
|------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Date | `--date` | serial | `yyyy-mm-dd` | `2025-01-10` |
| Date-time | `--datetime` | serial + frac. day | `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm` | `2025-01-10 12:00` |
| Percent | `--percent` | the fraction (0.25) | `0%` | `25%` |
| Currency | `--currency` | the amount | `¥#,##0.00` | `¥1,200.00` |
| Thousands | `--thousands` | the amount | `#,##0` | `1,234,567` |
| Fixed decimals | `--number --pattern "0.00"` | the number | `0.00` | `3.14` |
| Scientific | `--number --pattern "0.00E+00"` | the number | `0.00E+00` | `1.23E-04` |
| Fraction | `--number --pattern "# ?/?"` | the number | `# ?/?` | `3 1/4` |
| Negative red | `--number --pattern "#,##0;[Red](#,##0)"` | the number | … | `(1,200)` |
| Force text | (write `{"v":"…","t":4}` directly) | any | `@` | as-is |

## Reading a large sheet in pages

A whole-sheet `docs sheet get` of a grid over the server's ~1MB read cap returns
`413 sheet_too_large`. Pass `--limit <n>` to read it in pages instead: each
response carries `hasMore` and an opaque `nextCursor`; feed that back via
`--cursor` until `hasMore` is false. Paging slices only the cells; `sheetDims`,
`sheetHyperLinks`, `sheetMerges`, `sheetList`,
`sheetFreeze`, `sheetFilters`, and `sheetDataValidations` all come back on the
first page only. Each page is bounded by both `--limit` and the byte cap, so no
page exceeds ~1MB regardless of `--limit`.

```bash
cursor=""
while : ; do
  page=$(octo-cli docs sheet get d_123 --limit 1000 ${cursor:+--cursor "$cursor"} --format json)
  echo "$page" | jq '.data.sheetCells'          # process this page
  more=$(echo "$page" | jq -r '.data.hasMore')
  [ "$more" = "true" ] || break
  cursor=$(echo "$page" | jq -r '.data.nextCursor')
done
```

**Concurrency / errors.** The base version is optimistic-concurrency: if the
sheet changed since your `docs sheet get`, an edit is rejected with
`412 base_version_stale` — re-read for a fresh token. During a paged read, if the
sheet is written between pages your `--cursor` is rejected with
`409 sheet_changed` (restart from the first page for a consistent snapshot).
Other gates: `409 unsupported_doc_type` (target is a doc/board/whiteboard),
`413 too_many_cells` / `413 too_many_sheet_resources` /
`413 too_many_data_validations` / `413 cell_too_large` (write size and count caps),
`400 invalid_body` (missing base version or malformed shape),
`400 invalid_limit` / `400 invalid_cursor` (bad pagination params), and
`422 sheet_cell_invalid` (a cell/dim/drawing/hyperlink/merge/tab/freeze/filter/
data-validation violates its contract or key shape). The server removes an
`operator` from otherwise-valid `list` / `listMultiple` rules; omit it so the
request and readback are identical. A write intersecting a protected range returns
`403 protected_range`.

## Exporting a sheet to Excel (.xlsx)

For a standard workbook export, use the server-backed command shown above:
`octo-cli docs export <docId> --export-format xlsx -o spreadsheet.xlsx`.
Only when custom reconstruction is required should a bot read the sheet and
serialize it locally: `docs sheet get` returns the readable worksheet state —
`sheetCells` (`{v,f,s,p,t}` per cell), `sheetDims` (column widths / row heights),
and the other returned worksheet maps. Feed those into the spreadsheet library
available in the bot's runtime (for example, `xlsx-js-style` in Node or
`openpyxl` in Python). Read and retain `sheetList` before writing any cells; in
paged mode it is returned on the first page only. For each tab, use its declared
`rowCount` / `columnCount`, falling back to 1000 / 100 only when stored counts
are absent. Split each `${logicalId}!r:c` key into its worksheet ID and 0-based
row / column, skip keys outside the effective boundary for that tab, then create
or select the worksheet, write `v` (or `f` as a formula),
apply `s` as the cell style, and preserve `p` rich text and `t` cell type when the
library supports them. Apply the same boundary when reconstructing other
coordinate-bearing worksheet resources. `sheetDims` is one workbook-level map whose keys
may be sheet-qualified: split `${logicalId}:c<idx>` / `${logicalId}:r<idx>` and
route each width or height to that worksheet. Bare `c<idx>` / `r<idx>` keys
belong to the legacy default sheet. Reads return all keys exactly as stored; do
not duplicate unqualified dimensions across every tab. Translate `sheetFreeze`,
`sheetFilters`, and `sheetDataValidations` into the library's freeze-pane,
auto-filter, and data-validation APIs when supported. For a large grid, page the
read with `--limit`/`--cursor` and stream rows into the workbook. Merged ranges
come back in `sheetMerges` (`logicalId:sr:sc:er:ec`) and tabs in `sheetList`, so an
export can carry each sheet's values, formulas, styles, merges, and worksheet resources;
only drawings remain write-only.

## Commenting on a cell

A sheet cell comment anchors to the cell key, not a text range — see
`common.md` (Comments → "Commenting on a spreadsheet cell").

## Schema lookup

```bash
octo-cli schema docs.sheet.get
octo-cli schema docs.sheet.edit
octo-cli schema docs.sheet.replace
```
