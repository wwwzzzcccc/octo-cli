and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`octo-cli docs sheet replace`** — performs one server-side, optimistic-
  concurrency-guarded find-and-replace over workbook values or formulas, with
  optional worksheet/range, case, and whole-cell controls. **Minimum rollout
  dependency:** release only after `octo-docs-backend` MR !132 is merged and
  deployed; on a mixed-version environment where this route returns 404, fall
  back to `docs sheet get` plus an explicit `docs sheet edit` batch.
- **`octo-cli marketplace plugin` family (unified plugin surface)** — one command
  family over the backend's unified `/plugins/*` API, replacing the retired
  per-type `skill` / `mcp` / `marketplace expert` / `marketplace squad` surfaces
  (44 legacy ops → 25). Resource kind is selected with `--plugin-type`
  (`skill` / `connector` / `expert` / `expert_team`; the old `mcp` maps to
  `connector`, `squad` to `expert_team`): `plugin list` / `get` / `version list`
  / `skillmd` / `download` / `upsert` / `delete` / `install` / `import` /
  `publish` / `delist`, plus the six-command `plugin review-request` workflow and
  `plugin-category list` / `plugin-tag list`. The skill
  upload→parse→import pipeline (`skill-upload`, `skill-parse-task`) and icon
  presign helpers are retained. Client-side gates before any request is sent:
  `plugin list` requires `--scene-code` and requires `--plugin-type` except for
  the all-types `--mode mine` view; `plugin upsert` requires a full `plugin`
  document (`plugin_name` / `plugin_type` /
  `visibility` / `manifest_json` / `plugin_json`) and gates `plugin_type`,
  `visibility` (`space` / `private`; the retired `public` is refused, matching
  `plugin import`), the `sort` vocabulary, and relations' `relation_type`
  (`expert_team_expert` / `expert_skill` / `expert_connector`);
  `mode` accepts only `mine`. Write ops (`upsert` / `delete` / `install` /
  `import`, plus the non-idempotent `skill-upload parse`) set
  `x-octo-retry: never` so ambiguous gateway failures surface as
  `RESULT_UNKNOWN` instead of auto-replaying a non-idempotent mutation.
  Value-level rules remain backend-enforced.
- **Marketplace publishing is an explicit, review-aware lifecycle.** `plugin
  upsert` and skill `plugin import` save drafts and version snapshots. `plugin
  publish` lists private content immediately, while Space-visible content opens
  a review request and stays draft until a Space owner/admin approves it. The
  `plugin review-request create|list|get|approve|reject|cancel` family exposes
  frozen-submission review, and `plugin delist` takes published Space content
  down without deleting it. Reads expose `listing_state`, `display_status`, and
  `review_id` so callers can distinguish draft, pending, published, rejected,
  and delisted states.
- **`octo-cli marketplace plugin install`** — installs an `expert` / `expert_team`
  plugin into a Loop workspace (`--workspace-id`, `--runtime-id`) through the
  unified API. This exposes the install-to-Loop capability that the retired
  per-type surface deliberately withheld; it is gated backend-side and
  provisions through octo-fleet.
- **`octo-cli loop` domain** — 126 registered commands generated from Fleet's
  Public API contract across tasks, executions, experts, expert teams,
  workspaces, runtimes, projects, skills, autopilots, attachments, comments,
  and labels. Loop uses explicit Workspace selectors, typed Autopilot dispatch
  fields, task lifecycle status including `in_review`, and a daemon-oriented
  task credential policy. The shared OpenAPI registry now resolves referenced
  parameters, request bodies, responses, nullable unions, and composed schemas.
- **`octo-cli drive` domain** (46 commands) — network drive over octo-drive:
  spaces and members, folder/file tree and `browse`, full-text `search`, blob registration,
  two-phase upload and signed download, online-document mounts, share links,
  invites, and IM-attachment transfer. 40 leaves are generated from the new
  `drive.json` spec (43 operations); six are hand-written because they are not a
  single request or take an argument shape the engine cannot express:
  `upload file` (prepare → presigned PUT → confirm, with best-effort cancel on
  failure), `download file` and `share download` (signed URL → atomic local
  write), `share create` (branches on blob vs mounted document),
  `share blob-create` (positional file id), and `share access`. Ships with the
  `octo-drive` Skill. There is deliberately no `drive org` subtree — the
  product's member picker is a frontend filter over the space roster, not a
  backend search.
  - **Dual identity, one command surface.** A `uk_*` user API key acts as the
    real person and routes to `/v1/user/drive/*`; `bf_*` / `app_*` act as the bot
    and route to `/v1/bot/drive/*`. The routing is spec metadata, not code, so the
    command tree is identical either way. A bot must still be added as a member of
    a shared space, exactly like a person.
  - **Share hand-over is the `share_url` and nothing else.** `share access` /
    `share download` take the whole link, parse it under strict same-origin rules,
    and call the configured API with the token they extracted — the link's host is
    never contacted. Both sides require a credential; there is no anonymous share
    surface. A document link is never downloadable.
  - **Lossless uint64 ids.** Drive file ids exceed both `float64`'s exact range
    and Go's `int`, so they are decimal strings on the CLI surface (validated in
    `[0, 2^64-1]`, sent as JSON integers, returned as decimal strings) and can be
    piped verbatim from one command into the next.
  - Presigned object-storage transfers run on a separate HTTP client that carries
    no Octo credential and no space header.
- **`OCTO_TOKEN`** — a preferred token variable accepting any of the three token
  kinds (`app_*`, `bf_*`, `uk_*`). Resolution order is now stored profile →
  `OCTO_TOKEN` → `OCTO_BOT_TOKEN`; `OCTO_BOT_TOKEN` keeps working exactly as
  before, so a setup that never sets `OCTO_TOKEN` is unaffected. The success
  envelope's `identity.source` names the variable actually used
  (`env:OCTO_TOKEN` or `env:OCTO_BOT_TOKEN`).
- **Generic spec extensions**, all opt-in with omit-means-unchanged semantics:
  `x-octo-allowed-token-kinds` (local credential-kind gate →
  `TOKEN_KIND_NOT_ALLOWED`, `validation`/exit 2, matching the existing
  message-search gate), `x-octo-mount-by-token-kind` (per-kind server mount,
  applied at the single path-assembly site in `cmd/service/run.go`),
  `x-octo-response-fields` (rename/duplicate response keys, so a backend DTO's
  ambiguous `id` can surface as `share_id` + `share_token`),
  `x-octo-lossless-id-fields` (uint64 response ids as decimal strings), and
  `x-octo-secret` (mask a value in `--verbose` / `--dry-run` without changing the
  wire). No pre-existing domain declares any of them.
- **`octo-cli docs search`** — permission-scoped full-text search across online
  documents, sheets, boards, and mounted HTML documents registered in docs-backend
  via `POST /v1/bot/docs/search`. Supports repeatable `--doc-type` filters, manual
  cursor continuation, and `--page-all`. Resolve an HTML result's `octoDocSlug`
  with `docs get` before continuing in the separate `html` domain.
  The metadata-driven pagination engine now supports custom item/cursor paths,
  explicit cursor-based has-more inference, POST body cursors, and opt-in
  repeated-cursor detection with a `PAGINATION_LOOP` error.
- **`octo-cli summary` domain** — `summary create|list|get|result` lets a
  personal Agent create owner-only summaries from explicit authorized sources,
  then discover and cite summaries visible to its human owner. The embedded
  spec targets the gateway's `/summary/api/v1/bot/*` mount, suppresses client
  space headers, and ships with the `octo-summary` Skill. Listing
  filters title or topic; result reads include citation metadata while the
  backend omits surrounding-message context for bot requests.
  **Currently withheld** behind `x-octo-disabled` (skill `disabled: true`):
  the commands and skill are not listed by the CLI **until the Summary
  backend create route (Mininglamp-OSS/octo-smart-summary#181) is merged and
  deployed, and the create feature
  is switched on via `BOT_SUMMARY_CREATE_ENABLED=1`**; `octo-cli schema
  summary.*` still introspects. Flip both flags in a one-line follow-up
  once the backend is live.
- **`octo-cli message search` family** (6 subcommands) — full-text message and
  file search: `message search` (messages), `search all` (messages + files),
  `search files`, `search media` (images/videos, in-channel only, no keyword),
  `search around` (context window around an anchor message, in-channel only),
  and `search groups` (cross-channel aggregated overview of which channels
  matched). `--chat-id` decides scope: with it, in-channel; without it,
  `search`/`all`/`files` route to their cross-channel `_search_global_*`
  endpoints (plain `search` cross-channel degrades to a mixed messages+files
  feed). Three token subjects: `bf_` (User Bot, searches as the bot),
  `bf_ --on-behalf-of <uid>` (OBO — searches as that real person, requires an
  active grant), and `uk_` (user API key — real-person identity, routed to
  `/v1/user/*`). `app_` (App Bot) tokens are **rejected locally** with a
  `validation` error before any request. Path routing (chat-id → global,
  `uk_` → `/v1/user`) is done CLI-side in `internal/client/search_route.go`;
  the `uk_` prefix is now a recognized credential kind (`user_key`).
- **`octo-cli html` domain** (20 operations) — an agent-facing CLI for the
  octo-doc interactive-HTML document service, a **separate backend** from
  `docs`. Covers the full lifecycle: `publish` immutable versions, `list` /
  `get` / `versions` / `rm`, author `draft save|promote`, `share` / `unshare`
  reader codes, per-uid `grant add|list|rm`, media `asset add|ls|rm`, inline
  `comment list|add`, agent `element get|replace`, and `reply`. Generated from
  the embedded `internal/registry/specs/html.json` OpenAPI spec; ships with the
  `octo-html` skill and CLAUDE.md command-tree docs.
- **`octo-cli docs share get|set`** — program the space-level share scope of a
  document. `docs share get <docId>` reads the current `{docId, shareScope,
  shareRole}` (needs reader); `docs share set <docId> --scope
  restricted|anyone_in_space [--role read|edit]` changes it (needs admin). The
  scope enum is `restricted` / `anyone_in_space` and the role enum is `read` /
  `edit`; a valid `--role` is required with `--scope anyone_in_space` and is
  ignored (stored as `read`) with `--scope restricted`. This targets the
  planned `/v1/bot/docs/{docId}/share` endpoint (backend lands in
  octo-docs-backend#68); merge this after that endpoint ships. Backed by a
  new `x-octo-flag` alias on request-body properties, so the clean `--scope` /
  `--role` flags front the `shareScope` / `shareRole` wire keys.

### Changed
- **`octo-cli docs members remove` now requires `--principal-space-id`** — Bot
  membership deletion is an exact Space-qualified mutation. Requiring the
  principal Space prevents an ambiguous uid from deleting the wrong row when
  the same uid has memberships in multiple Spaces.
- **BREAKING (marketplace): `plugin list` loses `--page-all`.** The retired
  `skill.list` / `skill.mine.list` operations declared `x-octo-pagination` and
  could be exhausted in one invocation. The unified `/plugins` endpoint is
  offset-paged (`--page` / `--page-size`, default 20, max 100, out-of-range
  rejected with 400 rather than clamped) and does not advertise the cursor
  extension, so `--page-all` is not registered. Callers that relied on it must
  walk `--page` until a short page. This matters most for the owned-name
  duplicate check: `--q` is a substring match against `plugin_name` only, so a
  single unpaged probe can report a false "not found".
- **BREAKING (marketplace): `plugin upsert` replaces the plugin row; it does not
  patch it.** There is no metadata-only PATCH on the unified API. The backend
  rebuilds the whole plugin from the submitted document, preserving only
  `created_at`, the version history and the creator identity — an omitted
  `category_id`, `publisher` or `icon` is accepted as empty and clears the
  stored value, and an omitted `relations` key soft-deletes every live relation.
  `plugin import` deliberately has the opposite semantics (omitted fields fall
  back to the existing row). The spec field descriptions and the
  `octo-marketplace` skill docs now state both, and prescribe read-modify-write
  via `plugin get`. Additionally, `manifest_json` must agree with the outer
  `plugin` fields (`plugin_name`, `plugin_type`, and `labels` == `tags` in the
  same order); every disagreement returns one opaque
  `400 VALIDATION_ERROR {"field":"body","reason":"invalid"}`.
- **`octo-cli html` adopts canonical create and document references** — create
  omits `slug`; the CLI generates `idempotency_key` once per invocation and
  reuses it across transport retries (an explicit key remains supported). It returns `data.doc_id` plus
  `data.slug == data.doc_id`, whether mounted or unmounted. Every later operation
  uses `data.slug`; old documents retain their legacy slug as that reference.
  Display names are metadata, not aliases, and same-name republish is unsupported.
  Query/body wire keys remain `slug`; path argument help now says `doc-ref` without
  changing request paths. Group, space, and thread mounts are all registered.
  Republish requires the saved `slug` and omits `idempotency_key`. `html draft
  create` provides the canonical no-reference draft flow (`POST /docs/draft`)
  with an idempotency key. Unattended callers should supply their own stable
  `--idempotency-key`: a generated key lives only for that invocation, so a
  re-run after an ambiguous failure creates a second document. A failed create
  reports the key it used in the error envelope so the outcome stays
  recoverable.
  **Minimum rollout dependency:** release only after the canonical-create changes
  in octo-docs-backend#166 and octo-docs-html#33 are merged and deployed.
- **Loop request validation now enforces its Public API constraints locally**,
  including composition, closed-object semantics, minimum object sizes,
  Unicode string lengths, and maximum array sizes. Existing service
  domains retain their previous backend-enforced behavior.
- **Unknown Loop Public API error codes use HTTP status taxonomy**, while
  legacy services retain their historical `api_error` fallback. A server hint
  remains presentation metadata and no longer changes the error type or exit
  code by itself.
- **The default gateway is now `https://im.deepminer.com.cn`** instead of the
  previous localhost development endpoint. Set `OCTO_API_BASE_URL` explicitly
  for test or self-hosted deployments.
- **Gateway configuration is origin-only** — `OCTO_API_BASE_URL` and stored
  profile URLs must contain only `http(s)://host[:port]`; service paths, query
  strings, fragments, and credentials are rejected. Existing profiles with a
  service-specific path must be updated with `octo-cli auth login` before use.
- **A transfer may no longer connect to the local machine, on the first connection as
  well as on a redirect hop.** The `https`-or-loopback-`http` rule is now decided on the
  *resolved* address rather than on how the host is spelled, and the connection then goes
  to the address that was checked, so a second lookup cannot answer differently in
  between. Previously only redirect hops were judged and only by spelling, so a hostname
  with an `A` record on `127.0.0.1` passed. Other internal ranges stay reachable — only
  this machine does not. **Deployment consequence:** a remote `OCTO_API_BASE_URL` whose
  object storage resolves to the caller's own machine will no longer transfer; point
  `OCTO_API_BASE_URL` at loopback to restore the local setup. A configured HTTP(S) proxy
  is still honoured, and a proxy on the local machine is not refused: it is not the
  storage host. Where the proxy is also the only resolver, the target cannot be
  classified locally and the transfer proceeds unclassified, reported under `--verbose`.
- **A malformed command line no longer echoes the argument it could not parse.** pflag
  and cobra quote the offending token in their own messages — `bad flag syntax: <x>`,
  `unknown flag: --<x>`, `unknown shorthand flag: 'A' in -<x>`, `flag needs an argument:
  <x>`, `invalid argument "<x>" for …`, `unknown command "<x>"` — and those went into the
  structured error on stderr verbatim. Because base64url share and invite ids commonly
  start with `-`, a missing verb or a mistyped flag name put an id there; `bad flag
  syntax` additionally carries the whole token, so `---password=<value>` printed the
  value. Rather than list the unsafe shapes, the rule is now default-deny: **any message
  about flag parsing is reported by category unless it is on an explicit allowlist of
  shapes that carry no caller value.** The allowlist is the ones carrying only counts or
  flag names (`accepts N arg(s)`, `required flag(s) "x" not set`) plus `unknown
  subcommand`, which lists this CLI's own subcommand names rather than the argument.
- **`--dry-run` masks the token inside `share_url`.** `share access` and `share download`
  masked the token in the request `path` and printed the same token verbatim in
  `share_url` one field below. A dry-run description is meant to be safe to paste into a
  ticket, so both are masked now; the `share_url` field is still present, with
  `***REDACTED***` in place of the token.
- **A numeric host a resolver would read as an address is refused in every base.** The
  rule previously looked for "digits and dots", so `0x7f.0.0.1` and `0x7f000001` were
  treated as ordinary names while the resolver read them as `127.0.0.1`. It now mirrors
  what `inet_aton` does — decimal, `0`-prefixed octal, `0x`-prefixed hex, and fewer than
  four labels — and refuses any such host that `net.ParseIP` does not accept. Names whose
  labels are hex *letters* (`storage.de`) are unaffected.
- **`OCTO_API_BASE_URL` with a path is now refused rather than silently trimmed.** Share
  links were built from the scheme and host only, so a deployment served under a path
  prefix produced links that looked correct and resolved to nothing.
- **`--data null` and `--params null` are now rejected instead of being treated as an
  absent value.** Both are valid JSON that decodes into a nil map. `--data null` — on any
  generated service command and on `octo-cli api` — used to behave like "no body", and
  with a promoted body flag it crashed (see Fixed); `--params null`, which is `octo-cli
  api` only, behaved like "no query parameters". Both are now `VALIDATION_ERROR` / exit 2
  with a message naming the shape. Every other non-object shape (`true`, a number, a
  string, an array) was already rejected; these two were the gap. **This is a
  user-visible behaviour change**: a script passing `null` to mean "nothing" must omit
  the flag instead.
- **A presigned URL whose host is not in canonical ASCII form is refused.** `net/http`
  canonicalises a host with IDNA before dialling it while the resolver does not, so a
  non-ASCII spelling was checked as one string and connected to as another — the
  fullwidth spellings of `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` passed every rule and reached the
  local machine. An internationalised storage host must be presented in its A-label
  (`xn--…`) form, which is what DNS carries; the CLI does not perform the mapping itself,
  because the checked string and the dialled string then could not be guaranteed equal.
- **An unknown subcommand no longer echoes the word it did not recognise.** Every
  service domain's parent command now reports
  `unknown subcommand for "octo-cli drive share"; available: access, blob-create, create, download, list, revoke`
  instead of `unknown subcommand "<word>" for "octo-cli drive share"`. The common way
  to land there is an omitted verb rather than a mistyped one — `drive share <token>`
  instead of `drive share revoke <token>` — which put a share token into an error the
  caller never asked to see; listing the real subcommands is also more useful for an
  actual typo. Exit-code classification is unchanged (still `validation`, exit 2).
- **Spec `enum` values are now enforced locally, before the request.** Enums were
  only rendered into `--help`; the value itself went to the backend unchecked, so
  `drive im-transfer create --im-channel-type 9` was forwarded despite the spec
  declaring `[1, 2, 5]`, and `-1` failed only as a backend decode error that
  leaked an internal struct name. The generic engine now rejects an out-of-set
  value with `ENUM_NOT_ALLOWED` (`validation`, exit 2, zero HTTP) and a hint
  listing the accepted values. Applies to every domain, on request-body fields
  (including nested and array-item enums, and values supplied through `--data`)
  and on query parameters alike. Comparison is by canonical form, so a value is
  accepted whether it arrives as an `int` flag, a `--data` JSON number, or a
  `json.Number` uint64. Only flags the caller actually set are checked, so an
  omitted optional enum field is untouched. Structural violations keep their
  existing `VALIDATION_ERROR` envelope. A non-scalar (object / array / null)
  against a scalar enum is rejected too, closing the last path by which a
  malformed value reached the backend and came back as an internal decode error.
  Because a spec enum narrower than the backend's real vocabulary would now
  refuse a call that used to work, `drive.doc.mount`'s `source` enum was
  corrected from `["user-mount"]` to `["user-mount", "docs-sync"]` (octo-drive's
  `docref.allowedMountSources` accepts both), and a regression test pins the
  drive enums against their backend allow-lists.
- **A path parameter may now declare `x-octo-flag`** to add an optional flag
  alternative to its positional slot. base64url ids legitimately start with `-`
  (about one in 64), which cobra parses as a flag before the command runs, so
  `drive share revoke -Ab3…` failed with "unknown shorthand flag" unless the
  caller knew to write `-- -Ab3…`. `share_id`, `invite_id` and `invite_token` now
  also accept `--share-id` / `--invite-id` / `--invite-token`; the `--` separator
  still works, positional parsing is unchanged, and supplying both forms for one
  slot is a validation error rather than a silent winner. Operations whose path
  params declare no `x-octo-flag` keep `cobra.ExactArgs`. A flag-parse failure on
  such a command now carries a hint naming both escapes. An empty flag value is
  refused, so `--share-id "$UNSET"` cannot address the collection URL.
- **Generated service commands now reject incomplete JSON bodies locally** —
  request-schema `required` fields and nested `minItems` constraints are
  validated after merging `--data` with promoted body flags, before any HTTP
  request is sent. Optional request bodies remain optional.
- **Renamed the binary and CLI command from `octo` to `octo-cli`** for
  consistency with the repository and Go module name. This affects every
  install path: release archives are now `octo-cli_<version>_<os>_<arch>`,
  `go install` builds `./cmd/octo-cli`, the Homebrew formula and `install.sh`
  install an `octo-cli` binary, and all commands are invoked as
  `octo-cli <command>`. **Breaking:** scripts, aliases, and shell completions
  that call `octo` must switch to `octo-cli`.

### Fixed
- **An explicit JSON `null` no longer walks past the local `enum` and `uint64` gates.** The
  body walker visited only non-nil children, so a property *present with value `null`* never
  reached the enum or uint64 check and was forwarded upstream — while the same field with an
  out-of-vocabulary or wrongly-typed value was correctly refused. Required fields were never
  affected (a present `null` is reported as missing), so the exposure was the optional
  constrained properties; a derived census over every embedded spec found **18** of them
  across `drive`, `docs`, `html` and `mcp`. Both paths now refuse it, each in its own terms.
  A `null` on a property with no enum and no `uint64` format is still forwarded — a backend
  may accept it to clear an optional field.
- **A presigned PUT answered `202`/`204` is no longer confirmed as a stored object.** The
  upload accepted the whole 2xx family, so an async or no-content answer from object storage
  returned success, the CLI went on to `confirm-upload` with the local byte count, and emitted
  `ok:true` for a drive row pointing at an object that may never have been written. There is
  no post-PUT verification anywhere in that path — no ETag comparison, no size echo, no HEAD —
  so the status code is the only evidence the bytes landed, and only `200`/`201` is that
  evidence. The other 2xx codes now fail as `UPLOAD_NOT_CONFIRMED`, kept distinct from the
  `UPLOAD_FAILED` a storage *refusal* produces, and the pending row is still cancelled. The
  download side's comment claiming the upload half "already refuses the same shape" was untrue
  when written; it is true now and says so.
- **`drive share create` no longer silently discards `--password` / `--password-file` /
  `--expires-in-seconds` on a document.** The share body — password included — was built before
  the node lookup and then dropped on the document branch, which issues no request at all, so
  the command exited 0 with a `share_url` an operator could hand over believing it was
  password-gated. It was not. A document link is an entrance into the docs permission system,
  not a grant this command parameterises, so supplying any of those three flags is now refused
  with `SHARE_FLAG_NOT_APPLICABLE` and no link is emitted. The check is on whether the caller
  *set* the flag, so `--expires-in-seconds 0` — a deliberate "use the backend default" — is
  caught too.
- **The `octo-drive` skill and a validation hint prescribed a `-r` flag the CLI does not
  implement.** `SKILL.md` used `-q '…' -r` fifteen times, across every step of all three
  copy-paste workflows, and the uint64 hint pointed at the same idiom; only `--jq`/`-q` exists,
  so each of those commands failed with exit 2. Removing `-r` alone would not have fixed them:
  `--jq` prints a JSON value and ids are JSON strings, so a captured id arrives quoted and the
  next command rejects it. The recipes now strip the quotes in the shell and say why. A new
  test walks every `octo-cli` invocation in every embedded skill and asserts each flag it uses
  exists in the command tree — the tripwire that keeps a recipe and the binary from drifting
  apart. It also found a pre-existing error in the `octo-shared` skill, where the pagination
  example used `--page-all` on a command that is not paginated.
- **A compressed reply can no longer switch off the download completeness check.** The
  transfer transport advertised `Accept-Encoding: gzip` by default, so a storage host that
  compressed had its reply decompressed transparently and `Content-Length` reported as
  unknown — which skipped the length comparison entirely and let a 1 KB response write
  1 MB to the caller's `-o` path, reported as a complete download at an
  attacker-chosen ratio. The reported `size` and `sha256` also described the expansion
  rather than the stored object, and a blob another client stored compressed was written
  out decompressed, so `download file` did not round-trip `upload file`. The transport now
  refuses content encodings, and the transfer tests cover the compressed case in both
  directions.
- **A short declared secret no longer reaches stderr through a non-JSON error body.** The
  text fallback in response redaction used the masker's prose boundary rule, which declines
  a secret under 8 characters unless it is delimited — so one adjacent character published a
  1–7 character password (an accepted input: `password` has no `minLength`) whenever a WAF or
  reverse proxy answered with HTML. The fallback now asks the same disclosure question the
  structured path asks and suppresses the whole body when the answer is yes; a body echoing
  no secret is untouched, so a secret-free diagnostic stays readable.
- **A declared secret is masked whatever JSON kind it arrives as.** Redaction masked only
  string leaves, so a backend echoing a declared value as a number or boolean defeated it
  with no mistake on the caller's part. Non-string scalars are now judged on their own JSON
  spelling, which leaves unrelated numeric ids untouched. On the request side `octo-cli api`
  instead **refuses** a non-string value at an `x-octo-secret` property: a type error cannot
  disclose anything, and widening the masker over every number would mask ordinary ids out
  of every diagnostic.
- **A JSON prefix no longer truncates a backend diagnostic.** Response redaction decoded one
  value without requiring EOF, so any body merely starting with a JSON token was rewritten to
  just that token — `404 page not found`, which is what Go's own `http.NotFound` writes,
  became the number `404`. Only a complete, valid JSON body takes the structural path now.
- **A short declared secret no longer survives in an object-key position**, on either side.
  Key masking used the bare masker, so a backend keying a per-id result map by
  `<password>x` — or a caller merging such a key through `--data` — published it. Keys now
  get the value rule in full, suppression included, and request-side key collisions collapse
  in sorted order so a `--dry-run` description no longer varies between identical runs.
- **`--params` array elements are JSON, not Go syntax.** An object, nested array or null
  inside a `--params` array fell through to `fmt.Sprintf("%v", …)` and went on the wire as
  `map[id:9007199254740993]`, `[1 2]` and `<nil>`, while the same value at top level was
  correctly encoded. Both positions now share one renderer, and a number keeps the exact
  digits the caller typed.
- **A refused zero-byte download no longer blames storage.** The behaviour is unchanged —
  an empty object and a transfer that delivered nothing cannot be told apart, and publishing
  an empty file with the sha256 of nothing is what the guard prevents — but `blob create`
  documents `size: 0` as a stated value, so such a blob can legitimately exist. The hint now
  names the CLI limitation instead of telling the operator to report a bug they do not have.
- **A share link is no longer printed when it fails to parse.** `url.Parse` returns an
  error whose text quotes the whole input, and on `share access` / `share download` the
  whole input is the link, so a malformed link put the share token into the error on
  stderr. The inner cause is reported instead, which names what was wrong without
  repeating it.
- **`--overwrite=false` is honoured on filesystems without hard links.** Publication
  refuses an existing destination by relying on `os.Link` failing atomically; when links
  were unavailable the code fell through to `os.Rename`, which replaces its destination
  unconditionally. The fallback now reserves the name with `O_CREATE|O_EXCL` first, so the
  refusal no longer depends on which filesystem the download lands on.
- **Response redaction no longer masks the envelope's own field names**, which a caller
  whose secret happened to be an ordinary word like `code` or `message` could trigger,
  destroying the machine-readable code. Redaction is also deterministic when two
  secret-bearing keys mask to the same name.
- **`--data null` with a promoted body flag crashed the CLI** with
  `panic: assignment to entry in nil map`, on every service domain. JSON `null` decodes
  into a nil map without error, and the promoted-flag merge then wrote into it. The same
  unchecked-successful-decode is fixed in `docs import`, where a `null` response body
  from the backend hit the same write.
- **Documented that `drive blob create` now verifies the object.** octo-drive's
  low-level register path used to take "this object already exists" on trust, so
  `blob create --object-path does/not/exist.txt` returned a confirmed row that
  browsed and shared fine and only 404'd on download. The backend now probes
  storage and rejects an unknown key with `invalid_argument`, and rejects a
  `--size` that conflicts with the stored object (`--size 0` for a non-empty
  object included — 0 is a stated count, not an omission). Spec description,
  design doc and skill say so, and all three now note that a register-path row
  carries no persisted download URL — `share download` on one is `not_found`, so
  `upload file` is the command for a shareable blob — and that an inconclusive
  probe (storage unreachable) surfaces as a retryable 500 rather than
  `invalid_argument`.
- **Corrected the `drive` role contract in schema, docs and skill.** The shared
  `Role` description claimed "super_admin and custom cannot be granted through
  member add / invite create", which is wrong for `custom`: octo-drive accepts it
  on `member add` / `member set-role` (it is the lowest rank, below
  `preview_only`) and rejects it only on `invite create`. Grantability differs per
  surface, so the schema, `docs/octo-cli-design.md` and the `octo-drive` skill now
  carry an explicit per-surface matrix instead of one blanket sentence.
  `super_admin` is never grantable — it is bound to the creator at space creation.
- **Corrected `im_channel_type`'s documented consequence.** The schema, design doc
  and skill all said a wrong value composes a different idempotency source key and
  transfers the same attachment twice. octo-drive keys idempotency on (target
  space, `type=blob`, object path), not on `source_key`; the channel type selects
  the route the message is read through, and a wrong-but-accepted value resolves
  the same attachment and replays the same row. The unsupported duplicate-transfer
  claim is removed; the field stays required.
- **uint64 precision in output and `--dry-run`.** The envelope re-parse and the
  dry-run body echo both went through a plain `json.Unmarshal`, so any integer
  above 2^53 was rounded to a `float64` before reaching stdout — a drive file id
  would have been reported as a different number than the one actually sent. Both
  now decode with `json.Decoder.UseNumber`. Affects every domain; `--jq`,
  `--format table` and `--format csv` render the exact literal.
- **octo-drive error codes are now mapped.** octo-drive replies with
  `{"error":"<code>","message":"..."}` — the code is a bare string, not the nested
  object the matters family uses, and the text is under `message` rather than
  `msg` — so `ParseBackendError` matched neither existing layer and fell back to a
  raw status dump. A third parse layer recognises that shape and maps the
  lowercase codes (`permission_denied`, `password_required`, `wrong_password`,
  `share_expired`, `not_found`, `conflict`, `invalid_argument`, `unauthorized`,
  `auth_unavailable`, `internal`) to CLI taxonomy and hints. A lowercase code and
  its uppercase counterpart classify identically — an agent branches on the CLI
  taxonomy and exit code, never on which backend answered — so only the hint
  differs. Free-text `error` values are not promoted to codes, and the uppercase
  mapping plus every unknown-code fallback are unchanged.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added
- **`octo skills` command** for embedded skill discovery — lists or
  extracts the Agent skills bundled in the binary (`octo-shared`,
  `octo-messaging`, `octo-files`, `octo-matter`). Useful for agent
  runtimes that load skills from `octo` at startup. (#16)
- **Encrypted credential profiles** via `octo auth login | status |
  logout | list` — bot tokens now live in `~/.octo-cli` (plaintext
  `config.json` metadata + AES-256-GCM `credentials.enc` token store)
  keyed by `--profile` / `--bot-id` (env `OCTO_BOT_ID`). `OCTO_BOT_TOKEN`
  remains a fallback. Each success envelope echoes the active
  `identity` (`{profile, robot_id, bot_kind, source}`) so agents can
  detect credential misuse. (#17)

### Changed
- **Matter domain withheld** behind a new `x-octo-disabled` spec flag —
  the spec stays embedded (`octo schema matter.*` still introspects it)
  but the command subtree and the `octo-matter` skill are hidden until
  the backend Matter API stabilises. Flip the spec flag and the skill
  frontmatter to re-enable. (#19)
- **Service-domain parent commands** (`octo thread`, `octo group`,
  `octo file`, …) now reject unknown subcommands with
  `unknown subcommand %q for %q` and exit 2 instead of silently printing
  help and exiting 0. Required by the `thread delete` removal so
  automation can detect a missing operation; also catches typos like
  `octo group lisst`. Parent help (`octo thread`, `octo thread --help`)
  still works without a token; only leaf operations require
  authentication.

### Removed
- **`octo thread delete`** — withdrew the thread-deletion command.
  Threads expose no bot-accessible archive or soft-close path, so a
  hard delete was inconsistent with the convention that bots get no
  destructive operations. The backend route is untouched; only the CLI
  command and its `thread.delete` spec entry are removed.

### Fixed
- **`octo file presigned`** and other `bot_api` specs realigned with
  octo-server — `file.presigned` now declares the required `fileSize`
  query param (previous calls failed with `HTTP 400 fileSize 参数必填`).
  Several other spec drifts also corrected. (#14)
- **Auth gate on service parents** no longer fires for parent help or
  unknown-subcommand handling — the `unknown subcommand` envelope and
  `octo thread --help` now work without a bot token, restoring the
  safety property of the `thread delete` removal.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05

### Architectural overhaul — metadata-driven command tree

This release replaces the hand-written command layer with an auto-generated
one, redesigns the output contract around a JSON envelope, and adopts
Factory-based DI throughout.

### Added
- **Metadata-driven service engine** (`cmd/service`) — every service command
  is auto-registered at startup from embedded OpenAPI 3.x specs. Adding or
  changing an endpoint is a spec edit, no Go code change.
- **Seven domain specs** embedded via `//go:embed`: `matter` (14),
  `message` (4), `group` (9), `thread` (9), `file` (4), `bot` (6),
  `event` (2) — 48 operations total.
- **JSON envelope I/O** (`internal/output`) — stable
  `{ok, identity, data, _pagination, _rate_limit}` success shape and
  `{ok:false, error:{type, code, message, hint, detail}}` error shape.
- **Error taxonomy + exit codes** — `auth_error` → 3, `validation`/`config`
  → 2, all others → 1.
- **Factory DI** (`internal/cmdutil.Factory`) — `ConfigFunc`,
  `CredentialFunc`, `ClientFunc`, `RegistryFunc` accessors; no mutable
  package-level globals.
- **Multi-service routing** — each operation selects its base URL from
  `x-octo-base-url` (matters, dmworkim, or the `OCTO_API_URL` fallback).
- **Universal flags** — `--format`, `--jq`, `--dry-run`, `--verbose`,
  `--timeout`, `--no-retry`, `--space`, plus `--page-all` / `--page-limit`
  on paginated operations.
- **Retry with exponential backoff + jitter** and `Retry-After` handling
  (client).
- **Multipart upload** and **binary/redirect response** handling for the
  `file.*` operations.
- **`octo schema` discovery command** — list and inspect the embedded spec
  registry fully offline.
- **`octo api` generic passthrough** — raw `METHOD /path` against any
  configured service.
- **`octo config show`** — resolved config with the bot token masked.
- **Agent skills** under `skills/` — `octo-shared`, `octo-matter`,
  `octo-messaging`, `octo-files` with YAML frontmatter.
- **Shell completion** via cobra's built-in `completion` command (bash,
  zsh, fish, powershell).
- **CI**: gofmt, vet, golangci-lint, `go test -race`, coverage, build,
  `go mod tidy` drift check, Go 1.24.x.

### Changed
- **Bot-only identity model.** `OCTO_BOT_TOKEN` carries an `app_*` (App
  Bot) or `bf_*` (User Bot) token; user login is removed.
- **Agent-first output.** Default format is `json`; no interactive prompts;
  stable machine-parseable envelope on every path.

### Removed
- Legacy hand-written `todo`, `goal`, `assign`, `comment`, and `attachment`
  subcommand trees. All equivalent functionality is now under `octo matter`
  and auto-registered from the spec.
